# credit_card_fraud-_detection-


This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm. The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, with features that have been transformed using PCA for confidentiality. The aim is to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ Features:
Data Preprocessing: Missing value check, data standardization using StandardScaler.

Data Visualization: Histogram plots for feature distribution.

Model: KNN classifier from scikit-learn.

Evaluation: Confusion Matrix and Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score).

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:
Python

Pandas, NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning

ðŸ”¹ Steps:
Load and explore the dataset.

Standardize features for better KNN performance.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train the KNN model.

Evaluate results using confusion matrix and classification metrics.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
The dataset used is Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle.
